title: "Migrating from CDKTF"
description: "Learn how to migrate your existing CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) projects to tfts."

tfts is designed to be a faster, simpler, and more modern alternative to CDKTF. Since tfts maintains high API compatibility with CDKTF, migrating your existing projects is straightforward.

## Why Migrate?

- **Performance**: tfts is built for the Bun runtime, offering significantly faster synthesis times.
- **Simplicity**: Reduced boilerplate and a more streamlined developer experience.
- **Maintenance**: tfts is actively maintained and optimized for modern TypeScript workflows.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update package.json

Remove `cdktf` and related dependencies, and add `tfts`.

```bash
# Remove CDKTF
bun remove cdktf

# Add tfts
bun add tfts
```

### Step 2: Update Imports

Change your import statements from `cdktf` to `tfts`.

```typescript
// Before
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";

// After
import { App, Stack } from "tfts";
```

Note: In tfts, `TerraformStack` is simply called `Stack`.

### Step 3: Regenerate Bindings

tfts uses its own code generator for provider bindings. Run the following command to generate them:

```bash
npx tfts get
```

This will read your `tfts.json` (or `cdktf.json` if you haven't renamed it yet) and generate the necessary TypeScript classes in the `.gen` directory.

## Automated Migration with ast-grep

You can automate the import updates using `ast-grep`. This is especially useful for large projects with many files.

```bash
ast-grep --pattern 'from "cdktf"' --rewrite 'from "tfts"' --lang ts -U .
```

## API Compatibility Notes

tfts aims for 100% API compatibility with the core constructs of CDKTF. Most of your existing code should work without modification after updating the imports.

- `App` remains `App`.
- `TerraformStack` is aliased to `Stack` (you can use either, but `Stack` is preferred).
- `TerraformResource` remains `TerraformResource`.
- `TerraformOutput` remains `TerraformOutput`.
- `TerraformVariable` remains `TerraformVariable`.

## Breaking Changes

Currently, there are no major breaking changes when migrating from the core CDKTF API to tfts. However, always ensure you run your tests after migration to verify the generated Terraform JSON remains identical.
