Manually release a stuck Terraform state lock.

## Usage

```bash
npx tfts force-unlock [stack] <lock-id> [options]
```

## Description

The `force-unlock` command releases a state lock that was not properly released. This can happen when a Terraform operation is interrupted or crashes.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `stack` | Stack name (optional, uses first stack if omitted) |
| `lock-id` | The lock ID to release (required) |

## Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `--output` | string | Output directory | `cdktf.out` |
| `--force`, `-f` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompt | `false` |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
npx tfts force-unlock abc123-lock-id
```

### Specific Stack

```bash
npx tfts force-unlock production abc123-lock-id
```

### Force Without Confirmation

```bash
npx tfts force-unlock --force abc123-lock-id
```

## When to Use

You typically need this command when you see an error like:

```
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
Lock Info:
  ID:        abc123-lock-id
  Path:      terraform.tfstate
  Operation: OperationTypeApply
  Who:       user@hostname
  Version:   1.5.0
  Created:   2024-01-01 12:00:00.000000000 +0000 UTC
```

## Safety

Only use `force-unlock` when you're certain no other Terraform operations are running. Forcing an unlock while another operation is in progress can corrupt your state.

Before using `force-unlock`:

1. Verify no other team members are running Terraform
2. Check for any stuck CI/CD pipelines
3. Wait a few minutes for any in-progress operations to complete
