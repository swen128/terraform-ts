description: "Show planned infrastructure changes"
---

Preview the changes that will be made to your infrastructure.

## Usage

```bash
npx tfts diff [stack] [options]
```

## Aliases

- `plan`

## Description

The `diff` command synthesizes your configuration and runs `terraform plan` to show what changes would be made to your infrastructure. If no stack is specified, it operates on all stacks.

## Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `--app` | string | Command to run the tfts app | From cdktf.json |
| `--output` | string | Output directory | `cdktf.out` |
| `--skipSynth` | boolean | Skip synthesis step | `false` |
| `--refreshOnly` | boolean | Only refresh state, no changes | `false` |
| `--target` | string | Target specific resources (repeatable) | - |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
npx tfts diff
```

### Specific Stack

```bash
npx tfts diff production
```

### Skip Synthesis

Use when you've already run `tfts synth`:

```bash
npx tfts diff --skipSynth
```

### Refresh Only

Only update state without planning changes:

```bash
npx tfts diff --refreshOnly
```

### Target Specific Resources

```bash
npx tfts diff --target google_compute_instance.web
npx tfts diff --target google_compute_instance.web --target google_compute_disk.data
```

## Output

The command shows Terraform's plan output, including:

- Resources to be created (`+`)
- Resources to be updated (`~`)
- Resources to be destroyed (`-`)
- Resource attributes that will change

## Automatic Initialization

If the stack hasn't been initialized, `tfts diff` automatically runs `terraform init` before planning.
